# # M3 Agentic AI - Turning functions into tools
# 
# ## 1. Introduction
# 
# ### 1.1. Lab overview
# 
# In this ungraded lab, you will create a set of tools with `aisuite` to give to an LLM. You will see how the LLM requests tools to be used and also the LLM choosing certain tools when relevant to its task.
# 
# ### 🎯 1.2 Learning outcome
# 
# Apply tool-calling design patterns to agent workflows.
# 
# To achieve this you will give LLMs controlled access to python functions via AISuite, manage parameter passing and execution flow, and validate multi-step outputs generated through tool orchestration.
# 

# ## 2. Setup: Initialize environment and client
# 
# As in previous labs, you will begin by initializing your environment. You will import several packages now and also later on as you build tools for your LLM.

# In[1]:


import json
import display_functions
from dotenv import load_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv()


# ### 2.1 Getting started with AISuite
# 
# Next, you'll initialize the **AISuite** client that you've seen in previous lessons. Once initialized, this will be your interface for generating agent responses and calling tools.
# 
# Run the cell below to initialize the client.

# In[2]:


import aisuite as ai

# Create an instance of the AISuite client
client = ai.Client()


# ## 3. Build your first tool
# 
# ### 3.1 Defining your function
# 
# Now that you have set up your environment. It is time to create you first tool. Run the cell below to define a function that returns the current time as a string. Notice that this tool includes a docstring explanation of the functions purpose. This is important for `aisuite` because it will use this to help define the tool to the LLM.

# In[3]:


from datetime import datetime

def get_current_time():
    """
    Returns the current time as a string.
    """
    return datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")


# Test out your function to what exactly this function returns.
# 
# <div style="background-color:#ffe4e1; padding:12px; border-radius:6px; color:black;">
#   <strong>Note:</strong> The DeepLearning.AI platform uses Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) by default. If you run this function locally, it will return your local time instead.
# </div>

# In[4]:


get_current_time()
"""
'15:42:48'
"""

# Great! Just as expected, the function returns a string that has your current time.

# ### 3.2 Turning your function into an LLM tool
# 
# Now, let's use `aisuite` to pass this tool to an LLM and get a response. To set up your tool, you first set up the `response` from the LLM. Creating a response first requires creating the message structure. The message structure includes the prompt the user asks, as well as a dictionary that represents the conversation history and each message having a `role` (e.g., "user", "assistant", "system") and `content`.

# In[5]:


# Message structure
prompt = "What time is it?"
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": prompt,
    }
]


# After defining your message structure you can construct your chat completion. This will make the LLM call for you and return the result. Let's take a look at the parameters in this call.
# * `model`: The model that will be used
# * `messages`: The list of messages passed to the LLM
# * `tools`: The list of tools that the LLM has access to
# * `max_turns`: This is the maximum amount of messages the LLM will be allowed to make. This can help prevent the LLM from getting into infinite loops and repeatedly calling a tool.
# 
# Run the cell below to call the LLM and see the response.

# In[6]:


response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    messages=messages,
    tools=[get_current_time],
    max_turns=5
)

# See the LLM response
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
"""
The current time is 15:42:49.
"""

# And just like that you've given your LLM access to tools! The `aisuite` tool turned your function into a tool that augmented the LLM's knowledge about the world.
# 
# ### 3.3 Taking a closer look at the response
# While the final response's content was just what was expected, there is actually a lot happening behind the scenes in the `response`. Let's use a helpful `utility` function to take a closer look. `pretty_print_chat_completion` will extract the steps from the response and show you the important parts in an easy to read format.

# In[7]:

"""

# As you can see, the LLM sent a message to use `get_current_time`. This was executed on your machine and sent back to the LLM. Finally, the LLM, having the full conversation history, used that information to give the final response. `aisuite` handled all the complexities of pulling out the message with the tool call, executing it locally, and then passing the message back to the LLM when you used `max_turns` and passed the function name to the client.

# ### 3.4 Manually defining tools
# 
# You saw that the docstring provided by our tool helped `aisuite` automatically turn your function into a tool for the LLM. This is very convenient. But what is happening behind the scenes to take your function and make it a tool?
# 
# Actually, what the tool looks like to the LLM is more complicated. Let's take a look at how the LLM is *actually* given a tool below. Like before, tools are given in a list. But in that list, the tools have set schema that they expect. Within this schema are several important parts:
# * `name`: The name of the corresponding function that you defined locally
# * `description`: A description that explains what the function does and is used by the LLM to help it decide when to use it
# * `parameters`: If your function has parameters, they would also be described with the parameter name and a description of what the parameter should be.
# 
# Run the cell below to define your tool using the schema.

# In[8]:


tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_current_time", # <--- Your functions name
        "description": "Returns the current time as a string.", # <--- a description for the LLM
        "parameters": {}
    }
}]


# In this case where you define a schema, `aisuite` expects you to handle the execution. So you will not use `max_turns`, and instead handle the execution yourself. Let's set this up by defining the response.

# In[9]:

# ## 4. Giving the LLM more tools
# 
# Now that you've explored how tools are created and how they are processed locally, let's create a few more tools.

# ### 4.1 Three new tools
# 
# You will define three new tools for your LLM:
# 
# - **Weather Tool (`get_weather_from_ip`)**
#   Detects the user’s location and returns the current, the high, and the low temperature using external API calls to detect your IP address and then send that to a weather API to get the current weather.
# 
# - **File Writing Tool (`write_txt_file`)**
#   Creates a text file with the specified content in your local environment. The function takes two arguments, `file_path` and `content`.
# 
# - **QR Code Generator (`generate_qr_code`)**
#   Generates a QR code image from data, with optional image embedding. The function takes three arguments: `data`, `filename`, and `img_path`.

# ### 4.3 Using multiple tools at once
# 
# Lastly, it's important to remember that LLMs can use multiple tools at and go through a sequence of tool calls to accomplish multiple things. Let's use your tools and examine the `response` to see what happens. You will use a complex prompt,
# 
# > Can you help me create a qr code that goes to www.deeplearning.com from the image dl_logo.jpg? Also write me a txt note with the current weather please.
# 
# This prompt requires a good amount of logic to understand what to call and when. For example, although you ask it to write a text note first and then describe the contents, the LLM will need that information first to pass it to the text note. If the LLM asked to use `write_txt_file` first, it would not have the information from `get_weather_from_ip`. This is a good example of the power of LLMs to parse natural language and use appropriate tools in the right order to accomplish a wide variety of tasks.

# And just like that, you see from the tool sequence that it called the tools in the correct order to accomplish the task, but responded in the order that you requested it.

# ### Model Options
# 
# You can experiment with different OpenAI models when running these tool-calling workflows. Each model offers a different balance of capability, cost, and speed:
# 
# - **`openai:gpt-4o`** — optimized for reasoning and speed
# - **`openai:gpt-4.1`** — strong reasoning performance, good for complex tasks
# - **`openai:gpt-4.1-mini`** — lighter, faster, and cheaper than full GPT-4.1
# - **`openai:gpt-3.5-turbo`** — efficient for simpler tasks and quick iterations
# 
# Choosing a model depends on your goals:
# - Use smaller models for fast, low-cost prototyping
# - Switch to stronger models when tasks require better reasoning or multi-step orchestration
# 
# 
# ### Final Takeaways
# 
# - Tool calling lets LLMs go beyond text generation—they can now use functions as part of their reasoning.
# - Clear, well-documented functions (with precise docstrings) help the model know when and how to use each tool.
# - AISuite handles the complexity of translating python functions into tool schemas and orchestrating multi-step workflows.
# - Choosing the right model matters: smaller models are faster and cheaper for simple tasks, while stronger models are better for reasoning-heavy workflows.
# - Watching the conversation flow (prompts, tool calls, results, final response) is essential for debugging and improving agentic behaviors.
# 
# With these elements in place, you now have the foundation to design agents that combine LLM reasoning with external tools to complete more complex tasks.

# 
# 🎉 <strong>Congratulations!</strong>
# 
# You’ve completed the lab on **turning functions into tools** with AISuite.  
# Along the way, <strong>you</strong> exposed Python functions as tools, let the LLM choose and call them, and inspected multi-step tool orchestration.
# 
# With these skills, <strong>you</strong> can design agentic workflows that combine LLM reasoning with real actions—reliable, auditable, and easy to extend. 🌟
